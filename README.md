# Graph-Based Assessor - AgentBeats GreenAgent

> Measure how, not just whether

A GreenAgent for [AgentBeats competition](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/agentx-agentbeats.html)
that evaluates **how agents coordinate**, not just whether they succeed.

## Novel Value

Graph-based runtime coordination analysis - measuring collaboration quality
through NetworkX metrics and LLM-as-judge evaluation.

## Evaluation Tiers

| Tier | Type      | Description                                   |
| ---- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Graph     | NetworkX metrics (centrality, efficiency)     |
| 2    | LLM-Judge | Coordination quality assessment               |
| 3    | Text      | Similarity metrics (plugin for PeerRead)      |

### Abstract

GreenAgent is a novel evaluation framework that measures **how agents
coordinate**, not just whether they succeed. The system combines graph-based
structural analysis (NetworkX metrics), LLM-as-judge assessment, and text
similarity scoring to provide comprehensive multi-tier evaluation of agent
coordination quality. Through A2A-compliant trace capture and directed graph
analysis, GreenAgent reveals coordination patterns, bottlenecks, and
collaboration effectiveness. We demonstrate perfect reproducibility (0%
variance) across metrics in independent evaluation runs, enabling fair and
consistent assessment of multi-agent systems.

### Demo Video

**Video URL**: [To be added - demo video showing agent startup, evaluation
flow, and results interpretation]

The demo video (max 3 minutes) demonstrates:

- GreenAgent server startup and A2A endpoint verification
- Purple agent evaluation flow with trace capture
- Multi-tier evaluation results (graph metrics, LLM judge, text similarity)
- Result interpretation and leaderboard integration
- See [Demo Video Script](./docs/ralph-results/DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md)

## Roadmap

- ✅ Phase 1: A2A + Graph + Basic eval (current)
- 🔜 Phase 2 (outlook): ART training on traces, potentially using [WeightWatcher](https://github.com/calculatedcontent/weightwatcher) or [PerforatedAI](https://github.com/PerforatedAI/PerforatedAI)
- 🔮 Phase 3 (outlook): Self-evolving GreenAgent, e.g., [DGM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04444)

**Note**: Time constraints limited full implementation of advanced features
planned in Phase 2 and 3. Current release focuses on core graph-based
evaluation with proven reproducibility.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run from GHCR (no build needed)

```bash
# Pull and run GraphJudge container
docker pull ghcr.io/qte77/agentbeats-greenagent:latest
docker run -p 9009:9009 ghcr.io/qte77/agentbeats-greenagent:latest

# Test (new terminal)
curl localhost:9009/.well-known/agent.json
```

### Option 2: Local development

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start GreenAgent server
uv run src/agentbeats/server.py

# Test (new terminal)
curl localhost:9009/.well-known/agent.json
```

## Development with Ralph Loop

```bash
# Generate task tracking from PRD
make ralph_init

# Run autonomous development
make ralph

# Check progress
make ralph_status
```
