## Setup

Ralph loop infrastructure:
- Scripts: .claude/scripts/ralph/ (ralph.sh, prompt.md, init.sh)
- Templates: .claude/templates/ralph/ (prd.json.template, progress.txt.template)
- State files: docs/ralph/ (prd.json, progress.txt)
- Skills: .claude/skills/ (designing-backend, implementing-python, reviewing-code, generating-prd)

Next steps:
1. Run `make ralph_init` to validate environment
2. Generate real prd.json: `claude -p` then ask to use generating-prd skill
3. Execute Ralph loop: `make ralph ITERATIONS=5`
