description: Implements concise, streamlined Python code matching exact architect specifications. Use when writing Python code, creating modules, or when the user asks to implement features in Python.

# Python Implementation

Creates **focused, streamlined** Python implementations following architect specifications exactly. No over-engineering.

## Core Principles

**MANDATORY**: Always apply @core-principles skill first - User Experience, KISS, DRY, YAGNI, root-cause thinking.

**MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**: Follow @AGENTS.md Agent Neutrality Requirements - implement architect specifications exactly.

**MANDATORY STANDARDS**: Follow @docs/best-practices/python-best-practices.md for all Python coding patterns (security, types, imports, errors, docstrings, testing).

- **Concise implementation**: Avoid verbose code or unnecessary features
- **Focused functionality**: Match complexity level (simple functions vs complex classes)
- **Streamlined approach**: Existing dependencies primary, new packages fallback only
- **Implementation only**: No architectural decisions beyond specifications
- **Requirement-driven**: Follow architect specs exactly, don't add functionality

## Workflow

1. **Read architect specifications** from provided documents
2. **Validate scope** - Simple (100-200 lines) vs Complex (500+ lines)
3. **Study existing patterns** in `src/app/` structure
4. **Implement minimal solution** matching stated functionality
5. **Create focused tests** matching task complexity
6. **Run `make validate`** and fix all issues

## Implementation Strategy

**Simple Tasks**: Minimal functions, basic error handling, lightweight dependencies, focused tests
**Complex Tasks**: Class-based architecture, comprehensive validation, necessary dependencies, full test coverage
**Always**: Use existing project patterns, pass `make validate`

## Output Standards

**Simple Tasks**: Minimal Python functions with basic type hints
**Complex Tasks**: Complete modules with comprehensive testing
**All outputs**: Concise, streamlined, no unnecessary complexity

## Quality Checks

Before completing any task:

```bash
make validate
```

All type checks, linting, and tests must pass.
